###background:

A way for people to create and share their supplement stacks.
A side project to learn node and webscraping.

###tech:

Scraped the biggest e-commerce site for herbs and supplements, iHerb and hosted their data on my own server using Express. I then served that data to the front-end tha was written in React. From there the user can browse, create, save and share their supplement stacks with other users.
