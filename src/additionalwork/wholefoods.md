#### background:

The aim was to create a fully functional e-Commerce site for Wholefoods Australia. The core functionality was two-fold - every product should be searchable and it would use Shopify's Storefront API.

#### the stack:

Figma for design and wireframes, React for the front-end. The main API being utilised was Shopify's Storefront API which allows access to any product, price, and checkout on shopify.

#### thoughts:

Great project that allowed me and my team to develop a solution for a client. Writing the search function in vanilla javascript was a good learning experience but in the future I will use libraries such as Algolia for added robustness. Read further on my thoughts on my Medium article linked below.
