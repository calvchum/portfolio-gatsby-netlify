### Background

Client wanted a React site designed and built from scratch with the following features: SEO friendly, blog, blog filter, email sign-up. This is Phase 1, the next phase will integrate the Shopify Storefront API.

### The Stack

**Gatsby** was chosen as the React framework due to it being a Server Side Rendered static site, which is more SEO friendly. This also allowed the use of neat Gatsby features such as fluid image loading and link hover pre-fetching. The result is, this is probably the fastest Ecze related website on the web right now.

For the backend, rather than build a Content Management System (CMS) from scratch, we opted to save development time by using a headless CMS - in this case, **Contentful** was chosen. This turned out to be a great choice as their API was very easy to integrate. Importantly, the client has a secure and robust back-end UI from where to manage their content.
